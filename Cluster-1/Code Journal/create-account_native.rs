/*
1) What are the concepts (borrowing, ownership, vectors etc)

===> The main concept is utilizing the CPI functionality of solana to make programs more composable, apart from that structs, iterators, msg are used.
All the parameters to process_instructions are passed as borrowed using & i.e only the reference is being passed
.clone() is also used to create a copy of the account and then pass it

2) What is the organization?

===> The code organization is very simple, such that it only requires you to pass the required arguments 
and it will invoke the system program to create account


3)What is the contract doing? What is the mechanism? 

===> The contract is used to create a new account which is owned by the system i.e only the system can modify 
the data in new account 

4)How could it be better? More efficient? Safer?

===> This is a simple and standard program used in solana ecosystem for account creation, 
so it's pretty safe and efficient. 

5)The code could be safer and better ifâ€¦..
